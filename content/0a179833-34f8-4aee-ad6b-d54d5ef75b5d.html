              A deeper understanding of prospect analysis involves evaluating not just customer spending habits but also examining credit evaluations and decision-making processes. Consider how much customers spend annually on specific products, and use this data to gain insight into their potential.

Practice phrasing questions with empathy and clarity to align with internal guidance, ensuring you never push back on objections but rather seek to fully understand them.
