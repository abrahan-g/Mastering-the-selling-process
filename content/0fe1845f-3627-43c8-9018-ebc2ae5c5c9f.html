                <p>Building rapport during initial interactions is fundamental in establishing successful customer relationships. Rapport is a crucial part of the sales process, particularly during the "Approach" step. Techniques for building immediate trust include active, empathetic listening and using the right questions and tone. Practice handling objections with empathy and consider practicing these interactions to refine your technique. This sets a positive tone for the rest of the sale.</p>
