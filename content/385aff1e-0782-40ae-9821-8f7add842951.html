                <p><strong>Customer engagement</strong> is crucial to a successful sales process, enabling representatives to build rapport and trust with clients. Key to this process is identifying 'right-to-win' customers who align with your product offerings, demonstrate credit-worthiness, and possess decision-making authority. Differentiating between spec-driven customers and decision maker-led clients helps tailor your engagement tactics. Successful cases, such as the SLA example, demonstrate how consistent service and effective follow-through enhance customer confidence.</p>
