              Adapting your sales strategy to align with the evolving market demands can significantly accelerate growth. For instance, establishing service agreements, as illustrated in the PPG success story, can instill confidence in customers who desire written assurances—a strategy overlooked by competitors like SW. This change not only differentiates you but also bolsters trust and reliability, encouraging client retention and expansion.
