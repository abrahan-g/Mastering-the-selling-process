                <p>Strategic interviewing within the 7-step sales process is crucial for gathering deep insights. Asking well-prepared questions helps understand client needs and opens opportunities for growth. For instance, questions like <em>“What are your spending habits on essential items?”</em> or <em>“How do you determine product specification needs?”</em> are pivotal. Using empathy and understanding client backgrounds lead to effective follow-ups and pinpointing growth potential. Practice questions with peers or in front of a manager to refine your technique and handle objections with care.</p>
